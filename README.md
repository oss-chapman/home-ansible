home-ansible
============

I'm learning ansible, so far I like it better than puppet, 
many of the same features are available in puppet, but take days to 
setup correctly. Here in ansible they seem to come out of the box and
ready to run. And chef is way to immature. I got tired of chasing
dependancies really quickly.

cheers.
